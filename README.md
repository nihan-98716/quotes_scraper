ðŸš— ESP32 Smart Car

An IoT and robotics project where I built a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth controlled smart car using ESP32.
The car supports manual control and autonomous features such as:

Real-time motion control (Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop)

Collision avoidance with Ultrasonic Sensor

Line Following Algorithm for self-navigation

Camera Streaming via ESP32-CAM for live monitoring

Compact and low-power hardware design

Tech Stack: ESP32, ESP32-CAM, Ultrasonic & IR sensors, L298N Motor Driver, Arduino IDE (C/C++), Wi-Fi & Bluetooth communication

This project highlights my skills in embedded systems, IoT communication, sensor integration, and robotics control systems.
